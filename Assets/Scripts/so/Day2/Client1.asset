  approvalEvaluationText: Bad approval. The client is unemployed and information
    suggests that they will not be able to reach the financial capacity to pay us
    back.
  rejectionEvaluationText: Sound rejection. The client does not have the capacity
    to pay us back, and a successful surgery does not guarantee that they will be
    able to in the future.
