  approvalEvaluationText: "Decent approval. Whilst the client does have a business,
    it is not necessarily profitable, though you couldn\u2019t have known that. Credibility
    and financial ability of the client are in question."
  rejectionEvaluationText: "Sound rejection, client\u2019s business has been reported
    as failing and close to foreclosure. Future prospect lost with no outright potential
    gains lost."
