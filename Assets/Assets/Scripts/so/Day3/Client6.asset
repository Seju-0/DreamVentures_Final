  approvalEvaluationText: "You\u2019re either suppressing your memories or too many
    blows to the head have rendered you mentally impaired. Do you not remember what
    \u2018khombra\u2019 means in the North? You\u2019ll hear about this soon enough,
    unfortunately."
  rejectionEvaluationText: "Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve informed the authorities.
    It must be a sensitive topic for you considering you\u2019re a veteran. I\u2019ll
    never understand how we came to a treaty with the North. They\u2019re savages,
    all savages."
